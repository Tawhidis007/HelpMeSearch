# HelpMeSearch
A simple desktop web searching app that also implements a Text to Speech system. 

This was a fun project for me trying to explore the things that could be done with Processes and Threads in Java. This was built with the help of Java Swing in Netbeans and in this project for the text to speech part, I have used the Mbrola TTS libraries.
